Learning

Hi! I'm Caitlin, but I prefer Cate. I am hoping to get an apprentice software engineer job, so I am teaching myself as much as possible to do this!! 
I have learnt a lot of C++, but my PC expert uncle said that Git was also a really useful skill to learn! I'm 23 and know I want to be software engineer, but I don't know what exact area of engineering I want to be in. Game Dev sounds like fun!
